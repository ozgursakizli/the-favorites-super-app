# Project Analysis – The Favorites Super App

## 1. Project Overview
The Favorites Super App is a **personal favorites manager** for Android.  
Users can create **custom categories** (e.g., Foods, Movies, Games) and add **personal items** with the following details:
- Title & Description
- Photo (Cloud-backed)
- Rating
- Location (optional)

The app demonstrates:
- Modern Android skills (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Hilt, Coroutines, Flow)
- Cloud integration (Firebase Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- Offline-first architecture (Room + WorkManager)
- Secure user authentication (Google login)

---

## 2. Core Features & How They Work

### 2.1 User Authentication
- Login with **Google account** via Firebase Auth.
- User-specific data stored securely in Firestore.
- Auth rules ensure users can only access their own categories and items.

### 2.2 Category Management
- Users can **create, read, update, delete categories**.
- Categories stored in **Firestore** and cached in **Room** for offline access.
- Sync handled by **WorkManager** to push local changes to Firestore when internet is available.

### 2.3 Item Management
- Items have **title, description, optional photo, rating, location**.
- CRUD operations similar to categories (Firestore + Room + WorkManager).
- Photos stored in **Firebase Storage** with secure URL references in Firestore.
- Offline changes synced automatically.

### 2.4 Sorting & Filtering
- Items can be sorted by:
  - Creation Date
  - Rating
  - Location proximity
- Sorting logic handled client-side when offline, server-side queries when online.

### 2.5 Offline-First Architecture
- **Room** caches all categories and items.
- **WorkManager** runs background sync tasks.
- Conflict resolution: latest modification wins by default.

### 2.6 UI/UX Features
- **Jetpack Compose** for modern, declarative UI.
- Item cards with animations.
- Pull-to-refresh functionality.
- Smooth transitions between category and item lists.

## 3. User Flows
1. **Login**
  - User opens app → Google login → Auth success → Navigate to category list.
2. **Manage Categories**
  - View categories → Add new category → Edit or Delete category.
3. **Manage Items**
  - Open category → View items → Add new item → Upload photo → Set rating → Optional location.
4. **Offline Mode**
  - User can add/edit categories and items offline → WorkManager syncs changes when online.
5. **Sorting & Filtering**
  - User selects sorting/filtering options → Items displayed accordingly.

## 4. Technical Notes
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth with Google login.
- **Database:** Firestore (cloud) + Room (local cache).
- **Offline sync:** WorkManager tasks handle retries and conflict resolution.
- **Storage:** Firebase Storage for photos.
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose with animations.
- **Security:** Firestore rules scoped per user; users cannot access others’ data.

## 5. Business Value
- Not just a CRUD app, but a **showcase for professional Android development**:
  - Clean Architecture → maintainability & testability
  - Secure design → Google Auth + Firestore rules
  - Offline-first → reliability & user experience
  - Modern UI/UX → Compose + animations
  - Professional documentation → real-world project simulation
